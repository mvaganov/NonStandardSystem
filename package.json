	"description": "NonStandard library imported using NonStandard package management\n\n* Proc, which can Delay functions and lambda expressions in a reflective way. This works in a Unity context, and is able to work in a pure C# context as well\n* Show is an abstraction over logging, with callbacks that can filter strings to be logged.\n* Global is a utility class that is intended to refrence a global dictionary of manager classes.\n* EventBind is a Unity convenience class that exposes functions which can assign methods to UnityEvent<> lists.\n* PlatformAdjust has callbacks to execute when a scene loads on different platforms\n* ObjectPtr is a UnityEngine.Object reference that can navigate it\'s own internal structure as part of assignment in the UnityEditor.\n* BuildTime places the build time of the project in a Resources folder, for reflective access at runtime.\n* PerfWarnOnSelection write a warning if an object is selected in edit mode. This is useful to explain to users in Edit Mode why performance is lagging (because an actively updated object is selected).\n* On2DEditorView performs callbacks when the user switches to 2D mode in the editor view..",
